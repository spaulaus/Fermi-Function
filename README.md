Fermi-Function
==============

A calculation of the Fermi function. This function does not provide any 
radiative, finite size, etc. corrections. There are two codes to 
calculate the function, one is taken from the parameterization by J. Kantele
the other uses the calculation (and approximation) of the Gamma function.
